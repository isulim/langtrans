## Task Objective

Your task is to build a prototype of an application that enables automated translations between the following languages: ["de", "en", "el", "es", "fr", "it", "pl", "pt", "ro", "nl"].

### Task details and deliverables

1. Model Choice: Choose an appropriate machine learning model or API that can perform the translation task. You may use pre-trained models or APIs available in libraries or platforms of your choice. 
 
2. Application Development: Develop a web application that allows users to input text in any of the given languages, select a target language, and see the translated text. 

3. Backend and Frontend: Your application should have a backend that manages the translation process and a frontend that allows user interaction. You are free to choose the technologies and frameworks for this. 
 

4. Running Locally: The application should be set up to run on a local machine. Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the application. 
 

5. Scalability Consideration: While the application will be run locally for this task, please provide a brief explanation of how you would scale and deploy this application using cloud resources in a real-world scenario. 
 

6. Documentation: Prepare a short document detailing your approach to solving the business problem, the design and architecture of your application, and instructions on how to set it up and run it locally. Describe briefly potential risks, biases and ethical implications of the model of your choice.
